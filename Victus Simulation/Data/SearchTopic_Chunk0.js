Friction is the force that resists the relative motion of solid surfaces, fluid layers, and material elements as they slide against one another. A friction factor is used to account for friction, as well as other sources of torque and drag effects. In addition to friction, torque and drag effects may also be caused by downhole dynamics, formation swelling, wellbore ledges, key seats, fluids, and the cuttings bed.
