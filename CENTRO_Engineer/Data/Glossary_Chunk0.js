For example, if 1 cubic inch of water at 39ºF weighs 1 unit and 1 cubic inch of another solid or liquid at 39º weights 0.95 unit, then the specific gravity of the substance is 0.95.

A check valve that opens upward on the lower end provides a way to remove the fluid from the well when pressure is insufficient to support flow; v: to operate a swab on a wireline to bring well fluids to the surface when the well does not flow naturally. Swabbing is temporary operation to determine whether or not the well can be made to flow. If the well does not flow after being swabbed, pump is installed as a permanent lifting device to bring the oil to the surface.',l:''},'sweet crude oil':{d:'oil containing little or no sulphur, especially little or no hydrogen sulphide.',l:''},'sweet gas':{d:'gas that has no more than the maximum sulphur content defined by (1) the specifications for the sales gas from a plant or (2) the definition by a legal body such as the Railroad Commission of Texas.',l:''},'synthetic-base fluid':{d:'a drilling fluid in which the continuous phase is a synthetic fluid, rather than an oil.
